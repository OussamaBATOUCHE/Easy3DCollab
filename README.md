#Easy3DCollab

In radiation therapy treatment, the plan review process takes a lot of time to finally decide on a specific plan. One of the main time-consuming tasks in this process is the need to have face-to-face interactions between the oncologist (O)  and the planners (P). To tackle this problem, we propose a complete solution that aims to have as few interactions as possible between the O and the P through our asynchronous collaboration platform. 
This would dramatically save the time for the plan review process and make it as 1) the O and the P will no longer need to meet physically, i.e., saving time for the oncologist who is one of the most critical resources, and also 2) provide them with a comprehensive 3D collaboration platform that is efficient and succinct as a fast way for the O and the P to communicate. We integrated our 3D collaboration platform with Varian APIs. 
However, as future plans, we envision to extend this idea for remote surgery, since our 3D collaboration feature requires very little overhead which makes it a great candidate for remote surgery application where fast internet connection is not available. We used Angular and ThreeGS for front-end and for back-end we used Google #FireStore, #Python, #Docker, and #AzureStorage.
